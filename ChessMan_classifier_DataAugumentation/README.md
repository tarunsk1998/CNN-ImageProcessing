# ChessMan_DataAugumentation_Classifier

### Overview
The ChessMan dataset is a kaggle dataset which consists of Chess piece images.
In this Jupyter notebook we are building a image classification model to classify different Chess pieces. The Jupyter Notebook involves,

- Image Preprocessing
- Data Augumentation

### Why ChessMan dataset
Chess has been a part of my life since the beginning. I always had the special place for Chess in my Heart. During Higher education and College the game had helped me in various way. As soon as I came across this dataset in Kaggle, I said to myself 'Why not!!'

So I decided to build a model to identify Chess pieces out of my passion.

### Accuracy details
Accuracy obtained with the CNN model was good. Given a very small dataset of only about 80 to 100 pictures per class the accuracy obtained was achievable with the help of Data Augumentation. I am pretty sure the model would perform better if trained for even higher training data.
