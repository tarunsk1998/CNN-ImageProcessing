# CNN_Mnist_classification_model

### MNIST Dataset brief overview:
MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms.

It is a dataset of 60,000 small square 28×28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9. The task is to classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9, inclusively.

### Accuracy details
The accuracy obtained by the model in CNN_classification.ipynb was about 99% on both training and test dataset.
