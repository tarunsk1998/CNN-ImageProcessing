# Live Sketch Application

This project is a Flask-python based application. The aim of the project is to capture the live feed from a camera (in this case my webcam) and provide a live sketch of the video feed.

### Overview
As the primary focus of the project is to provide the live sketch, the UI components are very simple. The project also provides a live feed just for comparision. 

### Libraries used 
 - flask
 - opencv
 
The hero of this project is Canny function of opencv which provides extraordinary results when it comes edge detection.

### Application
The applications of Edge Detection is huge especially in the Medical, Defence and Robotics fields. Some important areas where Edge detection implementation is focused currently are,
- robotics vision (e.g. Self Driving cars) - has a big future in this area
- classification of medical images (to find fingerprints for “diseases”such as tumors)
- license plate detection, etc.

### Video sample
The Live Sketch application sample video is provided along with this project.

### Future Project ideas
Planning to create a python-flask based application to create and play a game of "Hand Cricket". Hoping to have some fun along with learning.
